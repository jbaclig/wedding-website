                    Planning on attending the ceremony and reception and wondering what you should do in between? Don't worry, Jon and Kelly
                    got you covered! Below you'll find a selection of some of their favorite places to hangout near the ceremony
                    and reception venues. The Little Italy neighborhood where the ceremony is located features many of San
                    Diego's best restaurants and bars, while the Point Loma area where the reception is located features
                    a couple of the best breweries San Diego has to offer and other exciting food and drink options. There
                    are many more places than the ones listed below, and Kelly and Jon hope you get a change to explore two
                    of their favorite neighborhoods in the city!
