        <p>To All of Our Guests,</p>
        <p>
            First of all we'd like you to know that a gift is absolutely not required or expected. Taking the time out of your busy schedules
            to celebrate this special day with us is more than enough. If you do decide that you'd like to give us something,
            we kindly ask that you please donate to our savings so that we can start saving for a house and start our lives
            together. We decided not to register anywhere because we already don't have enough room in our small appartment
            for the stuff we have now, so we're not sure where we'd even put anything else! But the greatest present of all
            is your presence, and we can't wait to celebrate with all of you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Love,<br>
            Kelly &amp; Jon
        </p>
